at the top of each file is name of person who worked on that file

the project mainly revolves around the class thirdDObj and polygon which are able to load and graphically display 3d objects (in form of stl files)
in EZ,
usage of the 3d object class is at the top of the thirdDObj.java file 

the program uses array lists, file reading/parsing, 2D arrays, and public/private member variables
array lists are used in the loading of polygons see function at line 520 in thirdDObj.java
file reading see function on 104 in thirdDObj.java
the other two concepts are used heavily throughout the project

Instructions:
W, A, S, D to move,
Q and E to turn the camera,
f to switch from point cloud render to solid
g to switch from solid render to point cloud render
